Custom Data Table built in LWC

Using this datatable is simple, in [holder.js](https://github.com/martinmccarthy/LWC-Custom-DataTable/blob/master/force-app/main/default/lwc/holder/holder.js) edit the options array with the record type you would like to access, the value must be the object's API name. For example, Opportunities must include the value 'Opportunity'.
